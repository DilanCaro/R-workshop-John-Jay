# R Basics {-}

In our first session, we will lay the foundation for your R journey. We'll start with an introduction to R, delving into why it's a popular choice among data enthusiasts. You'll learn how to install R and RStudio, a user-friendly integrated development environment (IDE). We'll explore the basic layout and functionality of RStudio, setting the stage for your coding adventures.

We'll dive into R's fundamentals, treating it as your trusty calculator. You'll discover the various data types, from numeric to character, and grasp essential arithmetic operations. Moving forward, we'll explore R's data structures, including vectors for data storage and data frames for structured datasets. You'll also become adept at importing and exporting data using common formats like CSV files.

We won't stop there. The next part of our session is all about data manipulation. You'll learn how to subset and filter data, add, remove, and rename columns, and gain skills in basic data summarization and exploration. Finally, we'll wrap up with basic data visualization, where you'll create simple plots to visually represent your data.

# Part I: Introduction to R {-}

### What is `R` ? {-}

R is a programming language and open-source software environment that is widely used for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphics. It was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in the early 1990s and is now maintained by the R Development Core Team. R is particularly popular among statisticians, data scientists, and researchers for its extensive statistical and graphical capabilities.

#### Key features and characteristics of R : {.unnumbered}

1.  Data Analysis and Statistics: R provides a wide range of statistical techniques and libraries for data analysis, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, clustering, and more. It's known for its flexibility in handling data and conducting statistical experiments.

2.  Data Visualization: R offers powerful tools for creating a variety of high-quality data visualizations, including scatterplots, bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps. The ggplot2 package, in particular, is a popular choice for creating customized graphics.

3.  Open Source: R is open-source software, which means that it is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. This has led to a vibrant community of users and developers who contribute packages and extensions to enhance its functionality.

4.  Package System: R has a rich ecosystem of packages (libraries) that extend its core functionality. These packages cover a wide range of domains, from machine learning and time series analysis to bioinformatics and geospatial data analysis. Users can easily install and use these packages to tailor R to their specific needs.

5.  Cross-Platform: R runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

6.  Command-Line Interface: R primarily uses a command-line interface, although there are graphical user interfaces (GUIs) available, such as RStudio, which provide a more user-friendly environment for coding and data analysis.

7.  Community Support: R has a large and active community of users and developers who provide support, share code and tutorials, and contribute to the ongoing development of the language.

R is a versatile tool used in various fields, including academia, industry, finance, healthcare, and more, for tasks such as statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling. Its popularity continues to grow as data-driven decision-making becomes increasingly important in many domains.
