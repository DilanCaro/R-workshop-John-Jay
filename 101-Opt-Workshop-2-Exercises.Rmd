16. Almost there! In R, missing values are usually represented with an `NA`. Missing data can be tricky to deal with in R (and in statistics more generally) and cause some surprising behaviour when using some functions. Take a look at [Section 2.4.5](https://intro2r.com/vectors.html#na_vals) of the R book for more information about missing values. To explore this a little further let's create a vector called `mydata` with the values `2, 4, 1, 6, 8, 5, NA, 4, 7`. Notice the value of the 7^th^ element of `mydata` is missing. Now use the `mean()` function to calculate the mean of the values in `mydata`. What does R return? Confused? Next, take a look at the help page for the function `mean()`. Can you figure out how to alter your use of the `mean()` function to calculate the mean without this missing value?
